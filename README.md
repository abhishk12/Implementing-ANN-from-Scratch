# Implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from Scratch

## Introduction

In this project, I've implemented a Food/Non-food binary classification using **[Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "ANN")** from **scratch**. This project is taken from **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/food5k-image-dataset?select=evaluation "Dataset Link")** but the dataset is also available at **[this](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mmspg/downloads/food-image-datasets/ "Original Dataset Link")** link.
