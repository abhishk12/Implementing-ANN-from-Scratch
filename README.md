# Implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from Scratch

**_This project is intended to learn Deep Learning core concepts. I've also deployed the same project by using CNN algorithm and **[tensorflow API](https://www.tensorflow.org/)**. You can find the deployed project **[here](https://github.com/abhishk12/Food-Nonfood-ImageClassifier)**_**.

## Introduction

In this project, I've implemented a Food/Non-food binary classification using **[Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "ANN")** from **scratch**. This project is taken from **[Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/food5k-image-dataset?select=evaluation "Dataset Link")** but the dataset is also available at **[this](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mmspg/downloads/food-image-datasets/ "Original Dataset Link")** link. The images used for the dataset are scaled down to size of `64 X 64 X 3` and the model has 3 hidden layers and one output layer using sigmoid activation function. After evaluating the model gave an accuracy of `75.0%`.
